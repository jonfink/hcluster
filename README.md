_Based on the paper "Performance guarantees for hierarchical clustering" by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Philip M. Long_ [Download PDF here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/papers/hier-jcss.pdf)

Straight forward implementation of the Algorithm for points in R^4 with the Euclidian norm.

## Compiling
Only depends on STL and ROS (for building)

    make

## Usage
See the file test_hcluster.cc for a usage example.
